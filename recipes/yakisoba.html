            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound pork tenderloin, cut against the grain in thin strips</li>
            <li>2 cups carrots, cut into julienne strips/li>
            <li>1 medium onion, cut into julienne strips/li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 head napa cabbage, shredded</li>
            <li>2/3 cup yakisoba sauce</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons pickled red ginger (beni shoga), or to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons kizami nori (dried flaked aonori seaweed), or to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook soba in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Add pork and stir-fry with a pinch of salt and pepper, about 5 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate, reserving oil in wok. Add carrots, onion, ginger, and garlic to the wok and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cabbage to the wok and stir-fry briefly, about 1 minute. Add drained soba noodles. Pour in 1/2 the yakisoba sauce and stir-fry until noodles and vegetables are covered with sauce, about 3 minutes. Return pork to the wok. Add additional sauce as desired. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Garnish yakisoba with kizami nori and a small pile of beni shoga just before serving.</li>
            <li><strong>Recipe Tip:</strong> Chicken breast can be substituted for the pork, but make sure to cut it very thin or the texture will be off.</li>
        </ol>
